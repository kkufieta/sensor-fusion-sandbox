# sensor-fusion-sandbox

Collection of exercises from the Sensor Fusion Nanodegree.

## Important Notes
For the `detect_objects` project, there has to be a `dat` folder present that contains a `yolo` folder, which contains the following files:
* `coco.names`
* `yolov3-tiny.cfg`
* `yolov3-tiny.weights`
* `yolov3.cfg`
* `yolov3.weights`

Links for downloading the data:
* [yolov3.weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)
* [yolov3.cfg](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg)
* [coco.names](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names)
